# A word on class naming - different options 

A lot of the ideas that are presented in the following are modular ways to organize your CSS, with variations on how to approach and name your classes.

Whichever approach you choose, or even if you don't choose any and go with your own system or hybrid, you can learn a lot and get a lot of good ideas by reading through these approaches.

**BEM** http://getbem.com/naming/  
I've used BEM for years and it worked super well for me. A lot of great ideas in here :)

**CUBE** https://piccalil.li/cube-css/   
What I've found myself moving towards. This is about embracing CSS in a lot of ways that I talked about throughout this module, which I really like. A bit of a breath of fresh air.

**OOCSS** https://anotheruiguy.gitbooks.io/sassintherealworld_book-i/content/rules-to-live-by/oocss.html   
This is 100% worth reading about. The ideas presented as part of OOCSS have had a big influence on other naming convensions.

**SMACSS** http://smacss.com/   
I never really got into SMACSS myself, but there are a lot of great ideas in here.

**Atomic CSS** https://acss.io/   
I'm not a huge fan of going all in, but I see why people like it. I think there are valuable ideas in here though, with the idea of utility classes. I'm just not sure if we need one for *everything*. If you're familiar with Tailwind, this is sort of the idea that it's built on.
