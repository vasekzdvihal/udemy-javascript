### Updated Parcel Instructions

In the upcoming lecture, we will be installing the parcel-bundler tool globally to our system. 
This is no longer necessary as the new Parcel tool can be run without installation using npx.

To build the app and run the development server, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```terminal
    npx parcel index.html
```
