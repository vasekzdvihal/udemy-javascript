## Type Annotations and Inference

Type annotations + Type Inference is different when it's applied to Variables, Functions, or Objects.

### Type Annotations
Code we add to tell TS what type of value a variable will refer to. 
We (developers) tell TS the type.

### Type Inference
TS tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to.
Typescript guesses the type.
